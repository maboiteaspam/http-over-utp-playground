# HTTP over UTP Playground

An attempt to transport HTTP data over UTP.

It s a bunch of terrible hack to test and try this idea.

# UTP ?

Please see mafintosh/utp repository.

# Why ?

One of the motivation is the tcp hole punching difficulty. 

Seems much easier via UDP, thus,
if we could transport HTTP via UTP we could probably enhance user freedom.

Besides that, I just like to practice network programming : )
